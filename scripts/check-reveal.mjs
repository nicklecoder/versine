/**
 * Reveal discipline, enforced across the whole catalogue.
 *
 * No visual may show the answer before one has been committed. That rule has
 * held by care and review; this checks it by machine. Every problem in every
 * library is rendered in ask-state and the output is searched for the answer.
 *
 * Two visuals cannot express their answer as a withheld field -- wholesmodel,
 * because which half is the question depends on `direction`, and evalmodel,
 * whose reveal is progressive rather than binary. They are the reason this
 * exists: withholding covers the six that can, and this covers all eight.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/check-reveal.mjs

 * and abandoned: with a single-digit answer to "1/2 = ?/4" the digit 2 is
 * already on screen as part of the question, so the search cried leak on
 * thousands of correct problems. A check that cries wolf is worse than none.
 *
 *   1. Every field a schema marks `phase: 'answer'` is absent from the spec
 *      the renderer receives while the question is open. This is the property
 *      the withholding in visuals.js exists to guarantee, verified rather than
 *      assumed.
 *
 *   2. What a visual draws while asking differs from what it draws once the
 *      answer is committed. If the two are identical the visual held nothing
 *      back, which for a picture of a problem means it was showing the answer
 *      all along. This is what covers wholesmodel and evalmodel, whose answers
 *      cannot be expressed as a withheld field.
