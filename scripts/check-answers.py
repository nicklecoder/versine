"""
Re-derive answers independently of the generators that produced them.

Every other check asks whether a problem is well-formed. This asks whether it
is *right* -- by solving it again, in a different language, with arithmetic
that knows nothing about how it was made. A generator that disagrees with
itself passes every structural check: x/3 = 4 once claimed x = 4 while its own
worked lines said x = 12, and only substitution caught it.

Exact rationals throughout, never floats.

    A small, correct evaluator over exact rationals.

    Written properly rather than by translating the text into Python and
    calling eval, which was tried and produced three separate wrong answers
    from the checker itself: floats where rationals were meant, "1/2 ÷ 1/10"
    read as 1/2/1/10, and "2(a + 1)" split apart on its spaces. The last
    attempt got 10 ÷ 2 × 2 wrong -- which is the exact problem order-ops L2
    exists to teach.

        expr   := term (('+' | '-') term)*
        term   := frac (('×' | '÷' | '*') frac)*      left to right
        frac   := factor ('/' factor)*                binds tighter
        factor := '-' factor | power
        power  := atom ('^' factor)?
        atom   := number | '(' expr ')'

    The fraction bar and the division sign are two different operators here,
    and the bar binds tighter: "1/2 ÷ 1/10" is one half divided by one tenth,
    which is 5, not 1/20. Collapsing both to a slash loses that -- and reading
    it as a slash also makes "10 ÷ 2 × 2" come out as 5/2, which is the exact
    mistake order-ops L2 exists to teach.

    Juxtaposition is a multiplication, so 2(a + 1) works.
