 * The Time Trial clock, per student per level.

 * Nobody sets this by hand. It arrives one of three ways, in order:
 *
 *   1. an adapted clock the server has stored, from previous trials;
 *   2. a seed derived from how fast the student actually practised;
 *   3. nothing — the level is not ready for a trial yet.
 *
 * The authored `trial: { duration }` on a level is *not* used as the clock.
 * It stays a fixed reference pace for the Level calculation, so that adapting
 * one student's clock never changes what their Level means relative to
 * anyone else's.
