/**
 * Solving equations.
 *
 * One idea, applied until it is automatic: whatever you do to one side you do
 * to the other, and you undo the operations in the reverse of the order they
 * were applied. That reversal is the part worth drilling — a student who has
 * only been told "do the opposite" will subtract before dividing on 3(x+4)=19
 * and be wrong, because the bracket makes the multiplication outermost.
 *
 * Every solution here is a whole number. Not to be gentle: the widget follows
 * the answer's type, so a level mixing whole and fractional answers would show
 * two boxes exactly when the answer is a fraction, and a student would read it
 * off the input before solving anything. Fractional solutions get their own
 * level in the follow-on skill, where they are the whole level.
 *
 * The harder half — unknowns on both sides, brackets, non-whole answers —
 * lives in `equations-both`, which depends on this.
