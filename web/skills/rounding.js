/**
 * Rounding, and estimating with it.
 *
 * The catalogue could compute exactly in six notations and had no way to say
 * "about". That is a real hole rather than a missing convenience: an estimate
 * is how you find out whether an exact answer is plausible, and a student
 * with no habit of estimating has no defence against a slipped decimal point
 * or a division done upside down. Every other skill here produces answers;
 * this is the one that checks them.
 *
 * Filed under Decimals & Percents because rounding is overwhelmingly met on
 * decimals and depends on place value being solid — the whole skill is "which
 * of the two neighbours in this column is it nearer to", which is unanswerable
 * without knowing what the column counts.
 *
 * Everything here is positive. Rounding a negative is a genuine convention
 * argument — −2.5 goes to −2 under round-half-up and to −3 under
 * round-half-away — and a drill is the wrong place to have it.
