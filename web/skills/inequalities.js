/**
 * Inequalities.
 *
 * The skill that was missing from the map rather than merely absent from it:
 * every other empty corner of the catalogue has a category declared and
 * waiting, and this one had nothing at all. It sits beside Solving Equations
 * and reuses every move in it, which is probably why it slipped through — an
 * inequality is an equation until the very last step, and then it is not.
 *
 * There is exactly one new rule, and the whole skill is arranged around it:
 * multiplying or dividing by a negative turns the sign around. That rule
 * cannot be taught to a student who has never met a negative outside the
 * integer skills, which is the other reason this waited.
 *
 * The answers are whole numbers, not ranges. "x > 4" is the honest answer to
 * an inequality and there is no widget in this app that can take it, so the
 * questions ask for the smallest or largest whole number that works instead.
 * That is not a workaround: it is the reading that catches a student who has
 * solved correctly and then not thought about what the answer means, and it
 * makes the difference between > and ≥ worth something rather than decorative.
