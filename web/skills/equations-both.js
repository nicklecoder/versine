/**
 * Equations with the unknown in more than one place.
 *
 * The follow-on to Solving Equations, split off rather than bolted on: a
 * fourteen-level skill is a list that never ends, and a student should be able
 * to finish something. The foundations stay there, the harder work is here,
 * and this depends on that.
 *
 * The idea that carries all of it is *gathering*. Once x appears twice, you
 * cannot undo your way to it — you have to collect it on one side first, and
 * choosing which side is the first genuinely strategic decision in algebra.
 * Collecting on the side with more of them avoids a negative coefficient,
 * which is not a rule so much as a kindness a student can do for themselves.
 *
 * The level of non-whole answers exists because a student who has only ever
 * seen equations come out to integers learns to treat a fraction as evidence
 * of a mistake, and then hunts for an error that is not there.
