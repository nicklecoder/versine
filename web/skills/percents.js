/**
 * Percents.
 *
 * A percent is a fraction whose denominator is always a hundred, and nearly
 * every mistake made with them comes from forgetting the second half of that
 * sentence: *a hundred of what*. So the levels keep asking what the whole is,
 * and the last of them asks it about a whole that has changed.
 *
 * Percent change is the one that matters beyond school. A 20% rise followed by
 * a 20% fall does not return you to where you started, and a student who
 * cannot say why will be misled by a graph or a price for the rest of their
 * life. Two levels are about exactly that. By What Percent? asks for the
 * change as a proportion of what it started from, which is the only reading
 * that makes 40 → 50 a rise of 25% rather than of 10. Working Backwards
 * recovers the original from the new figure, and it is here because the
 * intuitive move — take the percent back off — is wrong, and wrong in the
 * direction that costs money.
