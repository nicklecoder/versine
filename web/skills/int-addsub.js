/**
 * Adding and subtracting positive and negative integers.
 *
 * Levels are ordered by the *idea*, not by the size of the numbers:
 * "subtracting a negative" is the hard one, so it gets a level of its own
 * rather than being buried in a general mix.
 *
 * One level asks the questions in words, and it is not decoration. Every
 * other level in this skill is symbols, so a student could clear the whole
 * thing having never once been told what a negative number *is* — and the
 * sign rules are exactly the arithmetic that a student will happily apply
 * backwards if they have no situation to check the answer against. −6 rising
 * by 9 is 3 and obviously not −15, and a thermometer says so faster than a
 * rule does. It sits after the four mechanical levels and before Chains: the
 * rules first, then what they are for, then speed.
