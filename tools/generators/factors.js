/**
 * The numbers this level asks about: every odd one in the range, and every
 * twenty-second even one.
 *
 * "Even, so 2" is a rule a student learns rather than one they arrive
 * knowing, so it has to be drilled. But an even number answers itself the
 * instant it is recognised, and a level made largely of them trains reading
 * the last digit instead of working up through the primes. One even number
 * every 22 puts 27 of them among 289 odds -- 8.5% of the level, which a Time
 * Trial meets about once.
 *
 * The stride does the spreading, so the evens run from 24 to 596 rather than
 * clustering in the small numbers. 22 is the stride and not a rounder one
 * because of two artefacts it avoids: the final digit advances by two each
 * time and so cycles through all five even endings, where a stride of 20
 * would have made every one of them end in 4; and 22 is not a multiple of 6,
 * where a tidier 18 would have made every even number a multiple of 6 and
 * never once shown 2 x a prime.
 *
 * The ratio lives in how many of each exist rather than in a draw
 * probability. The library is deduplicated by problem text and then dealt
 * from without replacement, so any number the generator can reach lands in
 * the file exactly once however rarely it is drawn -- a one-in-ten chance and
 * a one-in-two chance produce the same library. What a student meets is the
